# Lancelot

Lancelot is a fork of uBlock Origin, which is distributed under the GNU Public License. Lancelot was developed as a child-friendly tracker blocker using findings from a series of focus group sessions with children aged 7-11.

More information coming soon. This is currently a pre-release and the repository will be updated during the next few weeks.
